# SYNCHRONOUS-COMBINATIONAL-LOCK-USING-VERILOG
Security is a prime concern in our day-today life. Everyone wants to be as much secure as possible. A classic approach to access control is the rotary combination lock , which can be found on safes, doorways, post office boxes, etc. This typically mechanical device requires that a person wishing to gain access to a particular entryway rotate a knob left and right in a given sequence. If the sequence is correct, the entryway will If the sequence is correct, the entryway will unlock; otherwise, the entryway will remain locked, while conveying no information about the required sequence.To accomplish such a feat, we will introduce the Moore machine, which is a type of Finite State Machine (FSM), and the state diagram, which is a convenient way to represent an FSM.
